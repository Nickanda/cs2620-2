# CS2620 Design Exercise 3

## Installation

Our project uses only libraries that are included in the default Python installation. Importantly, we rely on the following:

- `socket` for socket handling
- `threading` for parallel processing of the three machines that we are simulating
- `unittest` for our unit tests

This was run on the Python 3.11.0, but should be compatible with Python versions 3.10.0 and above.

## Running the Project

To run this assignment, run `python main.py`. ALl log files will be outputted into this folder.

## Credits

This project is created by Nicholas Yang and Victoria Li. Portions of the code is created from generative AI, but may be modified. An exhaustive list of where this code can be found is listed here:

- Within our unit and integration tests
- Design of the virtual machine class
