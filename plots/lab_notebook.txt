Lab Notebook Summary
====================
Number of trials: 5
Run time per trial: 60 seconds
Variation mode: order
Internal event probability: 0.7

Observations and Design Decisions:
 - Note the size of the jumps in the logical clock values across events.
 - Document any observed drift between local logical clocks (using the system time).
 - Discuss the impact of clock cycle variations and the event probability settings on the message queue lengths and clock gaps.
 - Add any interesting observations and reflections on the simulation behavior here.
